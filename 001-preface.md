## Preface

Welcome to *Rails Database Patterns.*

Ruby on Rails is a framework built on the Ruby programming language. The Rails framework provides you with the tools you need to easily build a database-backed application. Rails has achieved widespread popularity - many popular websites run on Rails, including Shopify, Basecamp, and GitHub.

The ActiveRecord Query Interface makes it easy to access the database without writing any SQL code. As your application becomes more complex, your database schema grows, and the amount of data in your database increases, you'll reach the point where queries are running slower than you'd like.

This book will walk you through a number of ways to fine-tune your code and database, from running _explain_ with the existing queries to determine where to add indexes, to combining queries using CTEs to reduce the number of calls to the database.

Even if your go-to language isn't Ruby, hopefully this book will give you an overview of how to fine-tune your database and make your users happy again.
