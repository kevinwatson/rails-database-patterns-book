### Chapter 14 - Summary

Thank you for coming on this journey discovering *Rails Database Patterns.* I hope you had as much fun reading as I did writing this book. My hope is that this book has provided patterns that you can follow to scale your application and database interactions.

In this book, we've discussed relational database terminology, Active Record, Active Model, Arel, the Query Interface and query plans. With these tools in your toolbox, you'll be better prepared to make decisions in your architecture to allow you to scale your applications.

The learning does not stop here! Spin up a proof of concept project at work, get involved in a local user group and contribute to this or other documentation. As technologists, we're all on similar journeys, doing something we love and at the same time building our businesses.
